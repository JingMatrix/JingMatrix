### Hi there 👋

### [About Me](https://jingmatrix.github.io/cv)

I am a graduate student in mathematics and I am currently studying at Toulouse, France.

I was born on October 26th, 1998. However, you may already know that many Chinese people use a different [calendar](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chinese_calendar), so my birthday :birthday: 'changes' every year.

I like to write [:pencil2:](/categories/Chinese/), but mainly in Chinese. In my [Math Blog](/categories/math/) , I post the following:
  - Math notes
  - Computer program scripts
  - Excerpts from mathematical articles

My collection of math notes and ebooks is shared on [Google Drive](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1O279emuW9Z1LGmQ94fbRYfjZoxT8bpwU?usp=sharing).

In a sense, my taste is a bit retro:
  - For musician :musical_note:, I prefer [Beethoven](https://fr.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ludwig_van_Beethoven).
  - For director :movie_camera:, I prefer [Béla Tarr](https://fr.wikipedia.org/wiki/B%C3%A9la_Tarr), all of his movies are Black-and-White.
  - For writer :books:, I prefer Nietzsche, especially his [Par-delà le bien et le mal](https://fr.wikipedia.org/wiki/Par-del%C3%A0_le_bien_et_le_mal).
