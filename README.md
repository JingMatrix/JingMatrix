### Hi there 👋

### [About Me](https://jingmatrix.github.io/about/)

I am a PhD student in mathematics and I am currently studying at Toulouse, France.

I was born on October 26th, 1998. However, you might already know that many Chinese people use a different [calendar](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chinese_calendar), so my birthday :birthday: _changes_ every year.

I enjoy writing, in English, French and Chinese. There is a language switch button in [my blog](https://jingmatrix.github.io/) to see different contents.
  - [English](https://jingmatrix.github.io/en/): math notes, programming tricks, dairies
  - [French](https://jingmatrix.github.io/fr/): poems, life in France
  - [Chinese](https://jingmatrix.github.io/zh/): thoughts, poems

Using Google Drive, I share [Math books](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1O279emuW9Z1LGmQ94fbRYfjZoxT8bpwU) and other [Hobby readings](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1-5uxWOntIKyiwtsKfaKgsxlCYe6cFVFX); books there are well-compressed and include bookmarks (manually embedded).

In a sense, my taste is a bit retro:
  - For musician :musical_note:, I prefer [Beethoven](https://fr.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ludwig_van_Beethoven).
  - For director :movie_camera:, I prefer [Béla Tarr](https://fr.wikipedia.org/wiki/B%C3%A9la_Tarr), all of his movies are Black-and-White.
  - For writer :books:, I prefer Nietzsche, especially his [Par-delà le bien et le mal](https://fr.wikipedia.org/wiki/Par-del%C3%A0_le_bien_et_le_mal).
